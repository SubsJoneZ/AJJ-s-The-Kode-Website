                        In mostly every other technical field, the experienced individuals are stingy with knowledge because they think that being cut throat is the way to compete in their jobs or to secure their positions in a company. 
                        The coding community is the complete opposite. Developers are the most generous when it comes to sharing their experience, knowledge, leadership, and ideas.    
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">
                        We all enjoy the Internet and the access it gives us to information, entertainment, world cultures, you name it. But the greatest thing about the Internet is that a man named 
                        Tim Berners-Lee gave it away for free. Now anyone with a computer and an Internet connection could not only access it but also build off it.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">
                  Being a self taught web dev, I can honestly say that computer nerds today are definitely honoring Mr. Berners-Lee with the contributions of numerous free programs that we value so much like Github, Stackoverflow, Bootstrap, AWS, YouTube, and 
                  all the platforms that gives us equal opportunities to take programming further each day.

                        This information is designed to capture the interest of the communities that have fallen behind social economically. 
                        My belief is that, when they learn the high paying skills of programming, web development, software engineering, and data related structures, it will change that forever. It's not rocket science, it's computer science. 
                        You can learn these skills from home, and these skills can change your life and our communities drastically. 
                        It might seem unrealistic, but that's because we were never meant to crack "The Kode".

                  Coding is all about how creative one can be with the ultimate tools. Consider how computer technology has revolutionized the music industry, from the ways songs are created to the marketing behind it. 
                  Now days, recording artists are inclined to use programs like Protools to make the music they so desire. 
                  The creativity that comes out of the hood is undeniable, but often exploited by business people who work in the industry. From hip-hop to the sports world, the most talented entertainers
                  come from the hood. Personally, growing up I collected sports cards, Pokemon, and read comic books as my favorite form of entertainment. I have always been fascinated by the value of the images and stats of professional 
                  athletes, and the DC and Marvel style illustrations and stories. Now computer technology has taken these hobbies to a new level. Now 
                  it seems like the average experienced graphic designer has the skills to create new and improved versions of the characters I love. Just today I saw an 
                  unofficial fan version of Spawn that was incredible. I just recently found a website for trading digital sports cards as well as the physical ones that 
                  I still like to collect. What a time to be alive!    
              </p>
              <p class="lead" style="text-indent: 40px">
                Now imagine being able to build wealth while working from home. The same home in the same hood. Then imagine that there are others in your hood 
                that are catching on and receiving the same information. Now picture your community in the next 5 years. This is destined to make more of an impact
                than how hip-hop caught on like wildfire. Most coding bootcamps take just a few months to complete, and most degrees take only a few years. Depending on your desired path, one can go from poverty to affluent in a short 
                period of time. The average developer makes $100k a year, regardless of their age. Literally, the kid can be 12 years old making six figures. The technology that we 
                use today is still in the groundbreaking stages. Smartphones have only been around for 20 years. We are still in the baby stages of developing software, so whatever you 
                can bring to the table will truly be appreciated. And you will be in the history books, because these days technology is able to publicly store records forever and 
                be displayed by simply searching your name in Google. Therefore, it can be much easier to achieve rockstar status as a coder than as an entertainer.
